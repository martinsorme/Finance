# Personal GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where I share some of my work. \
The portfolio covers the following areas: 
### Financial risk 
Language: Matlab. \
Portfolio metrics: 
- Estimations of volatility and different types of methods for calculating Value at Risk (VaR).
- The VaR methods include: Exponensionally Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Hull & White, Rolling Window, Extreme Value Theory (EVT). 
- Implementation of statistical tests for comparing returns to VaR estimates. 

### Financial markets and instruments
Language: Matlab. \
Valuations of different options using different methods: 
- European Call Option (Binomial and B&S valuation)
- Calculations of implied volatility 
- American & European Call Option with dividends valuation
- Valuations of exotic options like down-and-in barrier option
- Sensitivity analysis

### Machine learning
Language: R. \
Labs in Machine learning 
- Lab 1 focuses on classification and prediction using KNN, linear regression, ridge regression and logistic regression.
- Lab 2 covers advanced regression techniques (lasso) and classification methods (decision trees, SVM) for various applications.
- Lab 3 covers kernel methods and neural networks for tasks like temperature prediction, spam classification and solving mathematical functions. 

### Development of a large application of Region Östegötland
Main languages: Python & TypeScript. \
Collaborating with 25 other students and Region Östergötland, we made a large application for managing tasks and different teams within the healthcare sector in the region. 

### Others

Java game: Made a game together with a friend connected to a Java course at LiU.
